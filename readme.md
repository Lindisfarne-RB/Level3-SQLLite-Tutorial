The complete project contains several files:
app.py

grocery_list.db

grocery_list.py
the file which created grocery_list.db

templates/index.html
The HTML template of the application, containing Jinja expressions

static/css/main.css
the stylesheet of the application

static/js/main.js
includes all the client side interactions of the app
Please note
Wayscript is unfortunatley gone and therefore the app is no longer hosted on their servers.
If you'd like to learn how to host your app on Heroku instead, I shor it in another tutorial of mine:
